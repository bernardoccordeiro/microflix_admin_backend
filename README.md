# Microflix Admin Backend

This repo is part of a bigger project (codename "Microflix") which aims to implement a web app which allows a user to sign up for a video service, browse videos and watch them.

This specific service is related to the Admin backend component, which allows Admins to upload new videos and manage existing ones in the service's database.
